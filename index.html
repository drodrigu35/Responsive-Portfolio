        <p class="big">I grew up with 4 siblings (3 older sisters and an older brother) im the creative one out of the bunch. 
        Ive always like to draw and paint since I was in elementary. So when i got into middle school I took 
        an Art class as an elective. It really taught me alot about color and different medias to use. 
        Then when I got in high school I really started to improve my drawing and painting skills. I also 
        started to develop an interest in sports. I wanted to play basketball, so I tried out for the 
        basketball team, but with my size I didn't make the the team. So I played alot of pick-up ball 
        around the streets or after school. After high school I went to The Art Institute of Houston to 
        learn about graphic design and a bit of art history. This is where I learned about Adobe software 
        (photoshop and illustrator) and some layout design. This is where also learned about some famous 
        artist like</p></div>
